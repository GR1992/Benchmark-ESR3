# Benchmark-cases-ESR3

This code can be adjusted to any OS, but in its current form it can be run on Linux only.

To run this code, Intel's MKL is necessary. Currently it is available at https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html


In order to run the code, edit the Makefile by adjusting all mkl paths according to your installation.
